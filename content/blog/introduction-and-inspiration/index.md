#### Hello! Allow me to tell you a bit about my vision for this blog.

&nbsp;
The main purpose of this blog is not to offer any new or transformational ideas or practices, nor is it's purpose to gain status in the software engineering community.
With the goal of cultivating a spirit of lifelong learning, my writings will primarily be for my own personal pedagogy -
to record my thoughts and ideas, to further solidify an understanding of something that I have learned,
or really to articulate any other idea which I thought interesting enough to record here.

That said, I also seek to not only consume content, but also to create content to be shared and enjoyed. Having received an education in computer science and now working full-time as a software engineer, I believe that sharing my thoughts and learnings in this blog is one way in which I can "give back" to any who wish to read. So go ahead, have a read around! And feel free to drop a comment at the bottom of any post.

##### References & Inspiration:

Much inspiration for my writings is drawn from these people who, whether they know it or not, have done much to shape my views on computer science/software engineering, as well as many other more important facets of life and learning:
